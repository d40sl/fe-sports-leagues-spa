# AI Tools Used

AI tools were used to complement my skills and help complete the task faster. All architecture decisions, design patterns, and implementation strategy were driven by me. AI served as a productivity multiplier — not a decision-maker.

## Tools Used

1. **Claude Code** (Anthropic)
   - Initial research on TheSportsDB API endpoints and response shapes
   - Code scaffolding and boilerplate generation
   - Code review and quality validation
   - Writing tests faster (assertion patterns, edge cases)
   - Documentation generation

2. **OpenCode with GLM-4** (Zhipu AI)
   - Additional API documentation research
   - Debugging assistance during development
   - Secondary code review pass

## What AI Helped With

- Researching API documentation and response formats
- Generating boilerplate code (component structure, test setup)
- Writing unit tests faster
- Debugging TypeScript and Sass configuration issues
- Writing documentation (README, this file)

## What I Did Myself

- All architecture and design pattern decisions
- Component decomposition and state management strategy
- Decision to use composables over Pinia for this scope
- UX/UI layout decisions and responsive design approach
- Performance optimization strategy (debounce, shallowRef, caching)
- Security considerations and input validation approach
- Final code review, quality pass, and all decisions
